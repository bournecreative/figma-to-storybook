# Figma to Storybook

This small example demonstrates how we could begin to build out a design system in Figma, planning out various component states using Figma's properties and variations, then building out these components as functional UI components and using storybook to describe the variations available for our use case components. 


## Figma Design System information 

You should be able to view the Figma link below whether you are logged into a Figma account or not. However if you are not logged into Figma,
you will not be able to view the local styles or components properties described when you select one of our two demo components in 
section 2.
